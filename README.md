### Hi there, I'm Siddharth Madupathi, a software engineer and a tech enthusiast ðŸ‘‹

I love building projects and learning more about tech and how everything runs under the hood. I have a bachelor's degree in computer science and one of the fields I'm invested more in is web development, and besides that, some other areas of interest would be networks and communication and distributed systems.
